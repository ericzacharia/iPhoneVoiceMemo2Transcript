 I remember in the book at the beginning, right now it's kind of like placing someone in the
 scenario and then it kind of ends with a question, which is, but I'm not really sure how long
 it'll take to get there.
 That question needs to really be rephrased in a way that makes, that almost asks the
 viewer of the video, like, actually asks them, like, have you ever wondered about actually
 maybe scheduling a budget to get to this goal rather than just hoping for the best and looking
 at the number and you're going to be like, something that's looking and actually asks
 the person, not just saying, this is a question that many people have, it's kind of different.
